Tuberculosis (TB) Burden Visualization in Power BI

Overview

This Power BI dashboard provides an interactive visualization of the Tuberculosis (TB) burden across different countries and regions over multiple years. The dataset includes key metrics such as TB prevalence, incidence, mortality, and case detection rates, helping users analyze global trends and regional disparities.

Data Source

The dataset used in this visualization includes:

Country and region information

Yearly estimated population

TB prevalence, incidence, and mortality rates (with confidence intervals)

TB/HIV co-infection estimates

Case detection rates

Methods used to derive estimates

Key Features

1. Global TB Burden Map

Visualization: Interactive filled map

Insight: Displays TB incidence rates per 100,000 population across countries.

2. TB Trends Over Time

Visualization: Line chart

Insight: Shows TB prevalence and incidence trends across different years.

3. Mortality vs. Incidence Comparison

Visualization: Scatter plot

Insight: Highlights relationships between TB mortality and incidence.

4. Case Detection Rate Analysis

Visualization: Bar chart

Insight: Compares case detection efficiency across countries.

5. HIV-Positive TB Cases

Visualization: Stacked column chart

Insight: Analyzes TB burden in HIV-positive populations.

Interactive Elements

Slicers: Users can filter data by Country, Region, and Year.

Dynamic Titles: Titles update dynamically based on selected filters.

Tooltips: Display additional insights such as confidence intervals.

DAX Calculations

Dynamic Title: Updates based on selected country, region, and year.

TB Prevalence per 100,000 Calculation: Ensures accurate rate representation.

Case Detection Rate Adjustment: Calculates percentage detection efficiency.

How to Use the Dashboard

Select Filters: Use slicers to refine the view by country, region, and year.

Explore Trends: Analyze trends using the line chart and bar charts.

Compare Mortality & Incidence: Use the scatter plot to identify high-risk areas.

View Geographic Distribution: Interact with the global map to see country-level data.

Future Improvements

Integration with real-time TB data sources.

Predictive modeling using machine learning.

Enhanced drill-down features for in-depth analysis.
